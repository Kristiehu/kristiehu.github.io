This project implements a **Python-based data pipeline** to collect live Twitter data, transform it into **ArcGIS-compatible 
CSV format**, and perform **spatial analysis** to examine geographic patterns and relationships.

The figure visualizes the global spatial distribution of tweets containing the hashtag #Pride, aggregated across six continents 
and categorized by posting time (morning, afternoon, and night). Distinct spatial clusters are evident in North America and Europe, 
reflecting higher tweet density and sustained engagement throughout the day, while regions such as Asia, Africa, and Oceania exhibit 
more sparse but geographically diverse activity. The temporal differentiation highlights regional posting behaviors influenced by time 
zones and local social dynamics, demonstrating how social media activity related to #Pride varies both spatially and temporally at a
global scale.

Data acquisition is conducted via the **Twitter Developer API**, using authenticated access through secure API keys. A custom 
Python script leverages standard libraries (`sys`, `pandas`) alongside `tweepy` to **stream, parse, and structure tweet data in 
real time**.

The workflow includes:
- **API authentication & streaming initialization**
- **Custom data schema definition** via the `CustomStreamListener` class  
- **Real-time ingestion, parsing, and logging** during execution  

The resulting dataset is exported as a **structured geospatial-ready CSV**, enabling seamless integration into **ArcGIS for 
downstream spatial analytics and visualization**.
